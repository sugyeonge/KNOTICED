## Overview

Critical error detection (CED) is a task that identifies an inherent risk of catastrophic meaning distortions in the machine translation (MT) output.
In this paper, we propose KNOTICED, a critical error detection dataset for English-Korean MT. With the importance of reflecting cultural elements in detecting critical errors, KNOTICED newly introduces the culture-aware "Politeness" type.
